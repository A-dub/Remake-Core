# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Test Dll

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  publish:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    # The container image to pull from dockerhub
    container: microsoft/dotnet:latest
